		<p id="about">
			I've been interested in all about computers since I laid my hands on a keyboard for the first time.<br>
			Programming is my favourite activity to reach a state of flow. Also reading (a lot) and flirting with Music.<br>
			My passion is to build interesting things that help re-shape the world. Curiosity is both a blessing and a grudge for me - sometimes I can't get enough.
